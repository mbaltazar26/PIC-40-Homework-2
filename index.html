            Happy April! If you’re into manga, you’ve probably heard of the shonen series <i>Chainsaw Man</i> by Tatsuki Fujimoto. If you haven’t, it is about a 15-year-old boy name Denji who lives in a world where human fears manifest into beings called devils. Denji merges with the Chainsaw Devil, and becomes a powerful being who can make chainsaws come out of his face and arms on command. He ends up fighting evil and makes friends along the way. I know it may sound silly, but its actually an extremely rich story touching on the philosophy of human nature with fantastic action scenes and world building. Earlier this month, I read the whole series in two days and it ruined me emotionally, spiritually, and mentally. To cope, I tried reading romance manga, and today I will be ranking the male leads.

            If you look at the table to the left, I have given each one scores in the different categories I think are important to a character. Up first, we have Lloyd Forger from <i>Spy X Family</i>, written by Tatsuya Endo. He’s a spy in a Cold War alternate universe setting trying to stop war, which I think is pretty nifty. I know he’s devoted his life to saving the world through lying about his identity and occasionally honey trapping, but he’s over 6’, so I can look past this.

            Next is Shiraishi Kouta from <i>Takane no Hana Nara Ochitekoi!!</i> by Natsume Ayano. He’s coaching a female classmate to stop acting like a typical shoju manga dream boy because everyone, both genders alike, keeps falling in love with her, causing many inconveniences in her daily life. He’s an LGBT ally and I trust him. 
        </p>

            Last place we have Mizukawa from <i>Mairimashita, Senpai!</i> By Azusa Mase. I thought this manga would be a meta parody of typical shoju manga, but alas. Not a fan, but if I was in middle school I would have loved it.
